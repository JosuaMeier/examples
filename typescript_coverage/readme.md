### Example Typescript/Gulp/Mocha workflow
*Assumption: node and npm is installed*

```bash
#if you dont have typescript or gulp
npm install -g gulp typescript typings
#package restore
npm install
```
To run tests:

```bash
gulp
```

> NOTE: For an integrated experience, try using VS Code - this solution makes use of a tasks.json file to integrate gulp with its task runner.
